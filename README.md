# What-Happened

Check the app [here](https://what-happened-91868.web.app/)

## Main Objective:

Record daily events, which in someway you find useful, either good or bad or...

### Main Features:

- record event - each event has its own timestamp
- each event is categorized by custom tags
- tags can be: - good - those are the best ones :D - bad - those could become educational. To become such, you need to make a plan for it(timebox it, etc).
  Each of the bad one will have emotion state related to it. - lesson-learnt(more info follows...) - dream tag(something you are dreaming to do). Dream tags can either become fulfilled, procrastinated, rejected.
  And each of those will have a reason for its current state. - private - by default all tags are public. When it's private only you and users granted permission can view them - what else?
- common behavior among all events: - resources section: will hold information about resources closely related to the event in mind - thought box: - estimate how important it is for you, how it will help you. When the event is transformed from a bad one to
  a good one, it will be tagged with: lesson-learnt, good, tags - history section: lists what changed during the lifespan of that event

Does this tool looks like:

- retro tool: yes
- diary or log: in a way
